### Purpose

Phren is additionally used to indicate the location of thought or contemplation and that is exatly what this application hopes to bring to anyone suffering from Psycological Disorders or Mental Illness's.

It is a well known fact that anyone with a mental illness is extrememly dependant on psychiatrist's. However pyschiatrist's are often overwhelmed, overworked and underinformed about their patients and what is going on in the medical/drug industry.

Phren bridges this gap between psychiatrists, their patients and the modern health industry. It is the memory that any normal human cannot have. It will allow normal people to get a personalized diagnosis of their pyscological disorders based uppon:

* Previous exeperiences with psyciatric medicine
* and if available Genomic data

When you have family memebers who are challeneged with serious mental illness and you watch them struggle everyday to function as a normal human being you begin to grasp at anything you can do to help. This is one of my attempts.

### Frustrations

In your journey to help your loved ones to find a normal, stable life you will probably run into some of the same things I have found like the following:

* I often see the helthcare industry be more concerened with making money off of other peoples pain and suffering...This is especially true when it comes to mental disorders.
* You will find that the resources available to you are minimal at best and nonexistant at worst.
* Often times your best option is to play a complex guessing game with a psychiatrist to try and figure out what medication fits just right for your loved one at this particular moment in time
* Heaven forbid that you want to start your family and want to have children
* Anything could change your biochemistry at anytime changing the effectiveness of your medication coctail that you have to take everyday just to function forcing you to start the whole complex guessing game to find a new mixture that works for you.
* You will often have no clue what the medications that your psychiatrist suggests actually do and you basically just pray it doesn't affect you adversely
* You will often wonder if the psychiatrist suggested the medication because they really think it is the best medicine for your case or because it is the first drug that came to their minds due to the excessively agressive marketing tactics used by drug manufactures.
* You will have no idea what side effects to look for from a new medication
